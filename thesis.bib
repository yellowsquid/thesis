abstract = {Jasmin is a framework for developing high-speed and high-assurance cryptographic software.
The framework is structured around the Jasmin programming language and its compiler.
The language is designed for enhancing portability of programs and for simplifying
verification tasks. The compiler is designed to achieve predictability and efficiency
of the output code (currently limited to x64 platforms), and is formally verified
in the Coq proof assistant. Using the supercop framework, we evaluate the Jasmin compiler
on representative cryptographic routines and conclude that the code generated by the
compiler is as efficient as fast, hand-crafted, implementations. Moreover, the framework
includes highly automated tools for proving memory safety and constant-time security
(for protecting against cache-based timing attacks). We also demonstrate the effectiveness
of the verification tools on a large set of cryptographic routines.},

  abstract = {CompCert is the first commercially available
optimizing compiler that is formally verified, using machine-assisted
mathematical proofs, to be exempt from mis-compilation.
The executable code it produces is proved
to behave exactly as specified by the semantics of the
source C program. This article gives an overview of
the design of CompCert and its proof concept and then
focuses on aspects relevant for industrial application.
We briefly summarize practical experience and give an
overview of recent CompCert development aiming at industrial usage.
CompCert’s intended use is the compilation of life-critical
and mission-critical software meeting high levels of assurance.
In this context tool qualification is of paramount importance. We
summarize the confidence argument of CompCert and give an overview of
relevant qualification strategies.}

abstract="We give an overview of Agda, the latest in a series of dependently typed programming languages developed in Gothenburg. Agda is based on Martin-L{\"o}f's intuitionistic type theory but extends it with numerous programming language features. It supports a wide range of inductive data types, including inductive families and inductive-recursive types, with associated flexible pattern-matching. Unlike other proof assistants, Agda is not tactic-based. Instead it has an Emacs-based interface which allows programming by gradual refinement of incomplete type-correct terms.",

abstract = {In this paper an attempt is made to explore the logical foundations of computer programming by use of techniques which were first applied in the study of geometry and have later been extended to other branches of mathematics. This involves the elucidation of sets of axioms and rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of computer programs. Examples are given of such axioms and rules, and a formal proof of a simple theorem is displayed. Finally, it is argued that important advantage, both theoretical and practical, may follow from a pursuance of these topics.},

abstract = {Auxiliary variables are essential for specifying programs in Hoare Logic. They are required to relate the value of variables in different states. However, the axioms and rules of Hoare Logic turn a blind eye to the role of auxiliary variables. We stipulate a new structural rule for adjusting auxiliary variables when strengthening preconditions and weakening postconditions. Courtesy of this new rule, Hoare Logic is adaptation complete, which benefits software re-use. This property is responsible for a number of improvements. Relative completeness follows uniformly from the Most General Formula property. Moreover, one can show that Hoare Logic subsumes Vienna Development Method's (VDM) operation decomposition rules in that every derivation in VDM can be naturally embedded in Hoare Logic. Furthermore, the new treatment leads to a significant simplification in the presentation for verification calculi dealing with more interesting features such as recursion.},
